      "Foster — Experience the joy of writing for its own sakeCohortsMembershipExperience the joy ofWriting for its Own SakeHi, we’re Foster. We’ve cultivated a way of writing together that leads to truer expressions of creativity and self. It’s fun, it’s interesting, and it makes writing easier, less lonely, and more fulfilling. Curious? Come try our signature Writing Circle and see what we’re all about.Join a Free Writing CircleFoster in the Words of the Collective“This writing circle has changed my life. Thank you for sharing this special gift with the world.”Maja T.“Thanks to Foster, I have reached an unimaginable level of acceptance and understanding of who I am. The community was critical in processing the loss of my mom, clarifying my vocation, and meeting people I love more than family.”Nicolas F.“Foster has helped me unlock myself in ways I didn’t know were possible.”Leo G.\"I can map the success in my writing career in lock step with joining Foster. It's not a coincidence.\"Sarah W.“Foster has been the best thing that’s happened for my writing and for my creativity.”Yashmi A.“Foster is so supportive and gives me space to take care of myself. It’s not just a writing program.”Daniela U.“What have you done to me? Writing used to be a side thang. All I do is write now 🤪”Azalea M.The Foster WayFoster combines community, consistency, and self-inquiry to help writers get into flow and unlock our truest, most authentic expression. Here’s how we do it.Be present with the questions, complexities, and muses we’re currently experiencing.Sense into our emotions and intuitions and write from a fully felt and embodied state.With the help of our peers, reflect on what we’ve written and make changes as necessary.Express ourselves, speaking creative new possibilities into existence, and attracting aligned others into our orbit.How We Practice TogetherWeekly Writing CirclesComing together on Zoom to write each week is our foundational practice. Writing Circles are artfully-crafted, 90-minute containers for writers to drop into what feels most alive and write from that place.Our facilitators play with meditation, somatic experiencing, breathwork, and other modalities to help writers drop into embodied states of flow and unfettered expression.After a dedicated period of focused writing, we circle back and share our experience, perhaps even reading something we’ve written.Join a Free Writing CircleMonthly CohortsThis simple but high impact communal practice helps writers develop and publish their truest, most courageous work, and reliably result in breakthroughs in writers’ personal and professional lives, too.In each Cohort, participants inhabit a deeply important question, complexity, or muse, and pull on that thread to see what unfolds. They also have access to peer support, Office Hours with professional coaches, and professional editing throughout the Cohort.Cohorts are recurring month-long initiations into the magic of writing that are somewhere between a course, bootcamp, accelerator, and Hogwarts, and yet not quite any of these things.Next Cohort starts Monday, July 1st — Learn moreBi-annual RetreatsTwice a year we get together in person for a few days to go deeper into our writing practice, our relationship with ourselves, and our relationships with each other. In the summer we convene in upstate New York, but in the winter we like to visit warmer locales (Mexico and Costa Rica, so far).We also make sure to have a little fun, going on excursions specific to the area we’re visiting.

All you have to do is show up and write down stuff that’s on your mind. That said, we do have a good mix of hobbyists and professional writers in Foster – and in fact, some of us have actuallybecome prossince joining!What does it mean to practice in community?It means we write together, and we do it often. Right now our weekly Writing Circles primarily take place on Zoom, but we intend to offer in-person circles as our community expands. We also host monthly Cohorts, connect via WhatsApp asynchronously, and get together in person twice a year for retreats.How do I join Foster?First things first,join one of our Writing Circlesto see if you like it. And then if you’re interested, you canjoin a Cohort.Will Foster help me become a better writer?Getting better at writing is like getting better at anything – you have to practice. So we keep our focus on showing up and doing just that. Not because it will do something for our career (though it might!), nor because it will help us gain a ton of followers (though it might do that, too!), but for the sheer joy of it. But yes, to answer your question, if you consistently show up to the practice, you will get better at writing.Will I 10X my productivity as a writer if I join Foster?That’s up to you and how often (and how earnestly) you sit down and just do it. That said, people who write with us reliably report breakthroughs in their work. They go deeper, push themselves to try new genres and forms, and publish more often as well.Are you trying to tell me with a straight face that you can make writing easier and more fun?Lol it’s crazy, right? But when you approach it like an experiment and explore what’s alive and true for you, writing has a way of becoming a lot more enjoyable. Plus, you get that wonderful feeling of clarity and accomplishment when you’re done writing. It’s addictive!CohortsMembershipLog in\n",

Here’s how we do it.Be present with the questions, complexities, and muses we’re currently experiencing.Sense into our emotions and intuitions and write from a fully felt and embodied state.With the help of our peers, reflect on what we’ve written and make changes as necessary.Express ourselves, speaking creative new possibilities into existence, and attracting aligned others into our orbit.How We Practice TogetherWeekly Writing CirclesComing together on Zoom to write each week is our foundational practice. Writing Circles are artfully-crafted, 90-minute containers for writers to drop into what feels most alive and write from that place.Our facilitators play with meditation, somatic experiencing, breathwork, and other modalities to help writers drop into embodied states of flow and unfettered expression.After a dedicated period of focused writing, we circle back and share our experience, perhaps even reading something we’ve written.Join a Free Writing CircleMonthly CohortsThis simple but high impact communal practice helps writers develop and publish their truest, most courageous work, and reliably result in breakthroughs in writers’ personal and professional lives, too.In each Cohort, participants inhabit a deeply important question, complexity, or muse, and pull on that thread to see what unfolds. They also have access to peer support, Office Hours with professional coaches, and professional editing throughout the Cohort.Cohorts are recurring month-long initiations into the magic of writing that are somewhere between a course, bootcamp, accelerator, and Hogwarts, and yet not quite any of these things.Next Cohort starts Monday, July 1st — Learn moreBi-annual RetreatsTwice a year we get together in person for a few days to go deeper into our writing practice, our relationship with ourselves, and our relationships with each other. In the summer we convene in upstate New York, but in the winter we like to visit warmer locales (Mexico and Costa Rica, so far).We also make sure to have a little fun, going on excursions specific to the area we’re visiting.

This simple but powerful month-long communal practice helps us deepen into our writing and produce a piece of work that stretches us both as writers and as humans.In Cohorts, participants explore a question, complexity, or muse that’s alive for them, write from that place, and express something meaningful. As part of the Cohort, they also have access to peer support, Office Hours with professional coaches, and professional editing via theFoster Chrome extensionthat they can access according to their capacity and desire.Each Cohort is four weeks long and begins on the first Monday of the month.

By the end of the one-month journey you’ll be able to practice this ecology on your own, toward truer expressions of creativity and self. You’ll know how to tap into creative flow states on demand, write emotionally-rich prose, and publish in a way that finds other resonant souls online. You'll also receive a Foster Foundations certificate and NFT to signify this baseline training in Foster’s practice.Who is this for?Writers who want to go deeper into the developmental aspects of their creative practicePeople who are familiar with these modalities and want guidance “pointing” them at writing and creative art practiceWriters and people who want to partake in a collective and community of practice that’s co-owned, co-operated and collectively intelligent to its coreSince Foundations includes extra attention and support for writers new to Foster’s practice, we have only 25 spots available.The next Foundations Cohort will be held in October 2024.‍$400Apply NowAn Ecology of PracticesThroughout the four weeks, writers participate in workshops that encompass mindfulness and somatic experiencing techniques to access our deepest truths as well as instruction in the craft of writing and revision to help us refine our written expression.Week 1:Be withour deepest questions, complexities and muses.

Most surprisingly, in the midst of my other writing, I’m writing poetry again.

Now, I'm writing a whole book.”Jess S. — Cohort 2“I have gone forward and actually published some of my essays on my newly created Substack! This was a huge leap of faith moment for me and I fought a lot of resistance, but here we are. Thank you wonderful Foster collective for an incredible experience.”Abdou S. — Cohort 4“Foster is completely innovative and a blessing for anyone who writes (or needs to write better). I haven’t seen anything like this in my writing career and I’ve completely embraced it. I love the community feel, the feedback, sound editing advice, and ease of use. This is really going to change writing for the better.”Lisa D. — Cohort 1FAQsWhat will I get out of a cohort?Cohorts offer a chance to be led through an experience of going deeper into a question, muse, or complexity you’re inhabiting. It’s a lot of writing, to be sure, but it’s more than that. It’s a chance to create space in your life to really explore a topic you’re excited to write about with structure and support that's hard to give yourself. It’s also a chance to meet like-minded people you might be interested in befriending or collaborating with in the future. On a more concrete note, Cohort writers reliably report breakthroughs in their work. They go deeper, push themselves to try new genres and forms, and publish more often as well.Who will I find in cohorts?Foster is filled with all kinds of people, from professionals and published authors to people who journal or write creatively as a hobby. What unites us is our belief in the power of the written word, and that translates into a welcoming group of earnest, curious, bright humans doing good work and stretching themselves.How much time will I spend on a cohort?That’s up to you! You can engage in them at various participation levels depending on your desire and capacity, but the minimum requirement is to join the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, which are each 90 minutes long, and to express something at the end.Does it matter what timezone I’m in?You can write with Foster from anywhere in the world, but please note that our events take place during business hours in the Eastern Time Zone in the U.S. (UTC−05:00 during standard time and UTC−04:00 during daylight saving time). We do share recordings afterwards that you can view asynchronously. With regard to Cohorts, the minimum requirement is to join the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, which are each 90 minutes long. These ceremonies take place at 1:00 pm Eastern on the first Monday and last Friday of each month, respectively.If I join Foster, do I need to join a Cohort every month?No. We recommend joining at least one cohort each year. Otherwise, you can opt in or out based on your capacity to go deeper into your writing practice that month.What are the minimum requirements to join a Cohort?Each Cohort is four weeks long and begins on the first Monday of the month and ends on the last Friday. You can engage in them at various participation levels depending on your desire and capacity, but the minimum requirement is to join the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, and to express something at the end.CohortsMembershipLog in\n"

      "The Foster Manifesto: Reclaiming the Transformative Power of Writing\n",
      "\n",
      "I. Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Words have the power to change lives, to reshape reality, to connect souls across time and space. Yet for so many, the act of writing has become a source of anxiety, isolation, and creative blockage rather than a wellspring of joy and transformation. I've felt it myself - the fear of the blank page, the harsh inner critic, the sense that my words don't matter. But through my journey with Foster, I've rediscovered the magic that happens when we come together to write, to share, to witness each other's stories. This manifesto is a call to reclaim writing as a profound tool for personal growth, community building, and social change.\n",
      "\n",
      "II. Problem Identification\n",
      "\n",
      "In our hyper-connected yet deeply alienated world, true self-expression has become increasingly rare and precious. We are bombarded by carefully curated social media personas, corporate messaging, and polarized ideologies. The art of writing - of articulating our authentic thoughts and experiences - is being lost in a sea of hot takes and clickbait. This disconnection from our own voices and stories leaves us feeling adrift, unseen, and creatively stifled.\n",
      "\n",
      "The root of this problem lies in our cultural obsession with productivity and perfection. We've turned writing into a performance, a product to be judged rather than a process to be experienced. Schools train us to write for grades, not for discovery. Social media trains us to write for likes, not for truth. We've forgotten that writing, at its core, is a deeply human act of making meaning, of processing our lived experience, of connecting with ourselves and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consequences of this disconnection are profound. We lose touch with our inner wisdom, our capacity for nuanced thought, our ability to empathize and understand diverse perspectives. Society suffers when we cannot articulate our hopes, fears, and visions for the future. The world needs your voice, your story, your unique perspective - now more than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "III. Vision and Values\n",
      "\n",
      "At Foster, we envision a world where writing is once again recognized as a transformative practice, accessible to all. We see writing circles sprouting up in living rooms, community centers, and online spaces across the globe. In these circles, people from all walks of life come together to write, to listen, to witness each other's journeys of self-discovery and creative expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our core values include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Nurturing non-judgment: Creating safe spaces where writers can take risks and explore without fear of criticism.\n",
      "2. Embodied presence: Reconnecting with the physical act of writing and the wisdom of our bodies.\n",
      "3. Authentic self-expression: Encouraging each writer to find and trust their unique voice.\n",
      "4. Community support: Fostering deep connections and mutual inspiration among writers.\n",
      "5. Transformative practice: Approaching writing as a tool for personal growth and social change.\n",
      "\n",
      "We believe that writing is not just a skill to be mastered, but a gateway to deeper self-understanding, empathy, and human connection. By reclaiming writing as a communal, embodied practice, we can unlock its full potential to heal, inspire, and transform both individuals and society.\n",
      "\n",
      "IV. Solutions and Strategies\n",
      "\n",
      "To bring this vision to life, Foster offers a range of programs and practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Writing Circles: Regular gatherings where writers come together to write, share, and support each other in a structured, facilitated environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Embodied Writing Practices: Techniques that integrate meditation, movement, and somatic awareness to deepen the writing experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Creative Unblocking Workshops: Targeted sessions to help writers overcome inner critics, fears, and creative blocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Community Publishing Initiatives: Platforms and opportunities for Foster writers to share their work with a wider audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Writing for Social Change Programs: Focused workshops that empower writers to use their voices for advocacy and community transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our approach is rooted in the understanding that sustainable change happens through consistent practice and supportive community. We encourage writers to commit to regular writing sessions, to share their work (even when it feels vulnerable), and to actively support fellow writers on their journeys.\n",
      "\n",
      "V. Call to Action\n",
      "\n",
      "The world needs your voice. Your story matters. Your perspective is unique and valuable. We invite you to join the Foster community and reclaim the transformative power of writing in your life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how you can get involved:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Join a Writing Circle: Find or start a Foster Writing Circle in your area or online.\n",
      "2. Commit to a Daily Writing Practice: Even 10 minutes a day can transform your relationship with writing.\n",
      "3. Share Your Work: Take the brave step of sharing your writing with others, whether in a Foster circle or beyond.\n",
      "4. Support Other Writers: Offer encouragement, feedback, and witness to fellow writers on their journeys.\n",
      "5. Spread the Word: Tell others about Foster and the importance of reclaiming writing as a transformative practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, every word you write is an act of courage, of creation, of connection. By showing up to the page, you're not just changing your own life - you're contributing to a larger movement of authentic self-expression and human understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "VI. Potential Impact\n",
      "\n",
      "As more people reconnect with the transformative power of writing, we anticipate profound ripple effects:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Individual Growth: Writers will experience increased self-awareness, emotional resilience, and creative confidence.\n",
      "- Stronger Communities: Writing circles will foster deep connections and mutual support networks.\n",
      "- Cultural Shift: A resurgence of authentic voices will counterbalance the superficiality of much modern communication.\n",
      "- Social Change: Empowered writers will use their voices to advocate for important causes and bridge divides.\n",
      "- Literary Renaissance: A new wave of diverse, honest, and impactful writing will emerge from the Foster community.\n",
      "\n",
      "By nurturing a global community of embodied, authentic writers, we're planting seeds for a more reflective, empathetic, and creatively alive world.\n",
      "\n",
      "VII. Addressing Counterarguments\n",
      "\n",
      "Some may argue that writing is an inherently solitary pursuit, or that true creativity can't be taught or facilitated. To this, we say: while the act of putting words on the page may be individual, the inspiration, courage, and growth that fuel great writing are profoundly communal. Our approach doesn't seek to replace individual writing time, but to complement and enrich it through shared practice and mutual support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Others might question the need for structured writing programs in an age of abundant online resources. We believe that information alone is not enough - transformation happens through embodied experience, consistent practice, and genuine human connection. Foster provides the container and community that many writers need to truly thrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "VIII. Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Writing has the power to change lives, to heal wounds, to bridge divides, to imagine new realities. But this power can only be fully realized when we approach writing not as a product to be judged, but as a practice to be lived. \n",
      "\n",
      "Through Foster, we're reclaiming writing as a transformative, communal act. We're creating spaces where authenticity is celebrated, vulnerability is honored, and every voice matters. This is more than just a writing program - it's a movement to reconnect with our deepest truths and share them with the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your story is waiting to be told. Your voice is needed. Join us in this revolution of the written word. Together, we can write a new chapter for ourselves and for the world.\n"
