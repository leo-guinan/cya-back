      "After a thorough diagnostic session, we've identified a critical condition in Rivalz's market positioning. The primary symptom causing investor concern is Rivalz's ability to compete effectively and gain market share in the highly competitive snack industry. This ailment is compounded by the established presence of major brands acting as dominant players, as well as the emergence of health-focused competitors introducing new challenges to the market ecosystem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our prescription for addressing this concern involves a comprehensive treatment plan. We recommend a Deck Rebuild focusing on Rivalz's unique value proposition, followed by a Storyboarding Workshop to craft a compelling narrative that differentiates them from established brands. The subsequent Narrative Outline will highlight Rivalz's innovative approach to penetrating the market, while the Full Build will showcase their strategy for carving out a niche despite the crowded landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, gaining market share is not a quick fix but rather a long-term treatment plan. We'll schedule follow-up appointments through our Extended Revisions process to ensure the pitch deck evolves with Rivalz's progress and changing market dynamics.\n"
