My name is Jag Sharma - and I’ve spent the last 12 years creating, developing and executing social media strategies for a number of global brands across a variety of industries, and have witnessed first-hand the impact that algorithms, behaviour modification, negative feedback loops, ad targeting, and mass data collection have had on shaping our world in a new direction. This podcast is all about making you aware - giving you the insight, a look behind the giant tech curtain - and allowing you to make your own fully-informed decisions on how you strategically play (or don’t play) their game. This is not about advocating for going dark or deleting your accounts, this is about looking under the hood and getting more informed about what’s really happening to us on a societal level as result of our tech driven lives. I’ll be producing a new episode regularly, so be sure to subscribe to receive a notification for a new release - you can also follow me on either Instagram (@jagsharma) or add me on LinkedIn, where I’ll be conducting debates and social experiments from the discussions within the episodes.

I'm excited to spend\\n[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.320]  some time here with you today. I went back out to the Creator Science universe, all\\n[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.120]  the channels, YouTube, the lab, Instagram, threads, LinkedIn, Twitter and I asked for some\\n[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.720]  more listener questions. These episodes tend to be some of our most popular and I love\\n[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.640]  doing them so we're going to keep rocking. [00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.680]  Now this is actually a part two. The first half of these questions I recorded in video\\n[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.680]  format with my producer Connor. We took a lot of the questions from YouTube and the questions\\n[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.000]  about YouTube and we prioritized those for a video episode on the channel. If you have\\n[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.040]  not listened to the part one and you want the part one, it doesn't really matter what\\n[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.400]  order you listen to these in. There is just more questions for you to learn about predominantly\\n[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.400]  related to YouTube or things that a YouTuber would care about over in the feed before this\\n[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.400]  episode or on the YouTube channel as the most recent video depending on when you're listening\\n[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.140]  to this. For this audio episode, we are going to dive into questions that I got from\\n[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.540]  the lab, from Instagram, from LinkedIn, Twitter and threads. But before we get into that,\\n[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.180]  I have a couple things that I want to tell you. [00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.700]  Thing number one, if you are not already subscribed to the Creator Science newsletter, please\\n[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.880]  do so. You will like it. Almost 60,000 creators subscribed to it already. It's at creator\\n[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.380]  science.com. It will help you become a professional creator in 10 minutes per week. So if you don't\\n[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.940]  already get that, I'm telling you, if you like the podcast, you're going to like the\\n[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.220]  newsletter. Just go to creator science.com. Thing number two, I've spent the last couple\\n[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.300]  of months building a new product called Creator HQ. And this is a templatized version\\n[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.740]  of my personal notion setup that is how we run the entire creator science business. It's\\n[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.980]  what we use for task management, content preparation, content publishing, content repurposing. [00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.060]  It's what I use to manage sponsorship campaigns and all of my relationships. It's my lightweight\\n[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.140]  CRM. All of this, I have pretty up cleaned up put together for you to implement in your\\n[00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.220]  business as well. I've shown it to a bunch of creators and they've always asked me, can\\n[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.820]  I have this? And the answer for a long time was no. But I have done the work now of turning\\n[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.340]  it into a set of templates that you can implement in the course of an afternoon, get up and\\n[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.260]  running and run your entire business out of. It will give you the peace of mind that everything\\n[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:21.500]  is in one place.\",\n",

[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.700]  Thing number one, if you are not already subscribed to the Creator Science newsletter, please\\n[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.880]  do so. You will like it. Almost 60,000 creators subscribed to it already. It's at creator\\n[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.380]  science.com. It will help you become a professional creator in 10 minutes per week. So if you don't\\n[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.940]  already get that, I'm telling you, if you like the podcast, you're going to like the\\n[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.220]  newsletter. Just go to creator science.com. Thing number two, I've spent the last couple\\n[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.300]  of months building a new product called Creator HQ. And this is a templatized version\\n[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.740]  of my personal notion setup that is how we run the entire creator science business. It's\\n[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.980]  what we use for task management, content preparation, content publishing, content repurposing. [00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.060]  It's what I use to manage sponsorship campaigns and all of my relationships. It's my lightweight\\n[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.140]  CRM. All of this, I have pretty up cleaned up put together for you to implement in your\\n[00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.220]  business as well. I've shown it to a bunch of creators and they've always asked me, can\\n[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.820]  I have this? And the answer for a long time was no. But I have done the work now of turning\\n[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.340]  it into a set of templates that you can implement in the course of an afternoon, get up and\\n[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.260]  running and run your entire business out of. It will give you the peace of mind that everything\\n[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:21.500]  is in one place.\",\n",
